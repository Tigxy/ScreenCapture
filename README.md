# ScreenCapture

Simple tool for taking screenshots to play around with. 
A benefit over e.g., Snipping Tool is that additional horizontal should help
in making a precise sreenshot. Moreover, screenshots are saved and can be
viewed at some later point in time.

In the future, a drawing option (simple rectangles, text) may also be included.
